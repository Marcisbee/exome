# Usage
@TODO

# Motivation
I stumbled upon a need to store deeply nested store and manage chunks of them individually and regular flux selector/action architecture just didn't make much sense anymore. So I started to prototype what would ideal deeply nested store interaction look like and I saw that we could simply use classes for this.

**Goals I set for this project:**

- [x] Easy usage with deeply nested state chunks (array in array)
- [x] Single source of thruth (can be multiple tho, but it's up to you)
- [x] Type safe with TypeScript
- [x] To have actions be only way of editing state
- [x] To have effects trigger extra actions
- [ ] Redux devtool support
